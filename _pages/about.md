Hi! I’m Youheng. I’m interested in mathematics and statistical learning theory. I’m a first-year PhD student in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences at Northwestern University, advised by Prof. [Yiping Lu](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/lu-yiping.html).

Before Northwestern, I had the fortune to work with Prof. [Nan Jiang](https://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/) in the CS Department at UIUC starting in Summer 2024. I also had the privilege to work with Prof. [Yuheng Bu](https://buyuheng.github.io/) in the ECE Department at the University of Florida starting in Summer 2023. I received my B.Eng. (with honors) from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in June 2025.


> I like to study machine learning through the lens of function spaces, where powerful mathematical tools often lead to sharper results. I think “infinity” is one of the best inventions in mathematics—so I usually prefer working in continuous or infinite-dimensional settings rather than discrete or finite-dimensional ones. These spaces often offer richer structure, stronger analytical tools, and greater expressive power for modeling real-world problems.

I have broad research interests (and potential interests) in:
- Information theory and high-dimensional statistics
- *Functional analysis, manifolds, and PDEs*$^\dagger$
- Mean-field particle systems and statistical physics
- General machine learning theory
- LLM-based automatic theorem formalization and proving

I also have past experience in *computer graphics* and the *lattice Boltzmann* method.

Something more about me (subject to change):
- My favorite director is Ikuhara Kunihiko (幾原 邦彦)
- My favorite band is Sōtaisei Riron (相対性理論)
- My favorite voice-actress unit is Trysail
- My favorite music producer/composer is Yuki Kajiura (梶浦 由記), including her projects FictionJunction and Kalafina.
- I enjoy (arcade) rhythm games, and my favorite composer is Shiki (RIP).
